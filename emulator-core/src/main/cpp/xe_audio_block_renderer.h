// The Android audio drivers' per-block processing, free of AAudio and OpenSL ES so the host

// game's frames, or the media player's own stereo), its gain is applied and bounded, a block
// that did not arrive in time is concealed without a step, and the output is resampled at the
// rate control's rate. Callback thread only: no allocation, no lock, no wait.
