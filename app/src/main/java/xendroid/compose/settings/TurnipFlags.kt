 * 15i (Eden `87d4c673`, Bannerlator `1933903c`): the TU_DEBUG flags the Turnip driver reads at
 * start, chosen one by one with what each does, instead of four fixed combinations. The value is
 * still the comma-separated list `Vulkan|turnip_debug` holds; flags this build does not list stay
 * as they are. Turnip ignores flags it does not know, and proprietary drivers ignore TU_DEBUG
 * altogether. Pure, tested on the JVM.
