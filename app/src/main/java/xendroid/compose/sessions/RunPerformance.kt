/**
 * Performance summary of one run (C02), built from the host's one-second samples
 * and the core's per-frame counters. What it is and is not:
 *  - the FPS figures are the distribution of 1-second guest averages, NOT per-frame
 *    percentiles or "1% lows";
 *  - the frame-time histogram IS per guest frame (present-to-present, 1 ms buckets),
 *    but a gap over one second (pause, loading) restarts the timing and is left out;
 *  - pipeline creation time includes pipeline cache hits, so it is time the GPU thread
 *    spent creating pipelines, not only driver compiles;
 *  - present submissions are frames accepted by the compositor, NOT measured scanout;
 *  - seconds while the guest was paused or produced no new frame are left out;
 *  - audio underruns are blocks the output had to conceal because the emulator had not
 *    produced them in time; device xruns are counted separately, and both are absent
 *    (never zero) when no audio output ran.
