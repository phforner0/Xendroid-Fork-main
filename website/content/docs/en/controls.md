The **Controls** area brings together who plays as P1 to P4, the touch options, physical controllers, vibration and motion, phones as controllers, and four tools: Key mapping, Touch editor, Test controllers and Phone as controller.

{{> print id=controles legenda="Controls area: who plays now, touch, physical controllers, vibration and motion, phones and the tools."}}

## Who plays

Controllers join as P1 to P4 in the order they connect. Without a physical controller, P1 uses the touch controls. Each player joins with the profile chosen in **Profiles → Who plays** (see [profiles](doc:interface#profiles-and-saves)).

## Touch controls

| Option | Default |
|---|---|
| Touch controls (each game can change this in its Details) | on; they start off if a physical controller was connected on first launch |
| Look | Modern (dark glass, colored letters); Classic remains an option |
| Opacity | 65%, from 20 to 100% |
| Hide by itself | after 8 s; 0 turns it off |
| Haptics | off |
| Hide while a controller plays P1 | on |
| Split screen | off; or on a half-open foldable, or always |
| Sliding between the buttons and onto a stick | off |
| Touch camera (the free right side turns the camera) | off |

The **Touch editor** moves and resizes each control and sets its dead zone and what is shown, with snap to grid and undo. **Saved layouts** (up to 30) can apply to a single game and per orientation (portrait or landscape), and you can export and import them.

## Physical controllers

Each connected controller shows up with its own ID, whether it has a gyroscope, and its own vibration strength. The **Core settings for controllers** card holds the stick dead zones and the Guide button, for all games (each game can change them in its Details).

- **Key mapping**: the key for each of the 16 buttons. A key that is already in use swaps places with the other one; with a controller, A picks, Y clears and X swaps A/B and X/Y. **Reset** goes back to the original map. One map applies to every controller.
- **Test controllers**: the drawn controller lights up whatever you press, with the sticks (and the core dead zone, adjustable there), the triggers, the gyroscope and vibration. Nothing reaches a game; hold B for one second to leave.

## Vibration and motion

- **Controller vibration**: Off, Low, Medium (default) or High.
- **Gyro camera** (off by default), **Gyro aim** (Always, Holding LT or Holding LB) and **Gyro sensitivity**. Calibration is in the in-game menu. Without the sensor, the app says the phone has no gyroscope.
- **Unbuffered input**: on by default, Android 11 or newer only.

The in-game menu still changes these options on the spot; here are the values each game starts with.

## Phone as controller {#phone-as-controller}

Experimental. A second phone joins the game as **P2, P3 or P4** (never P1):

1. On the phone running the game: in-game menu → **Controls → Phone controllers**. The app starts a server and shows the address (IP:port) and a 6-digit code.
2. On the other phone, with Xendroid+ installed: **Controls → Phone as controller** (“Use this phone as a controller”). Enter the address and the code and tap **Connect**.

Limits:

- private local network only (Wi-Fi, hotspot, Ethernet, USB or Bluetooth tethering), never mobile data, VPN or the internet;
- a new address and code each time the server starts;
- 10 wrong codes lock pairing until it is turned off and on again;
- both ends need the same protocol version.

::: nota The app's help text
The help text inside the game still says to open “Library → ⋮ → Use this phone as a controller”, an item the library menu no longer has. The right path is the one in the Controls area, above.

## Not in the app yet

These proposals from the interface redesign were left out, with the reason recorded in the [redesign document](repo:docs/ui-redesign/app.md):

- a key map for each controller (today one applies to all);
- finding the game on the network and scanning a QR code in phone as controller.

The [simulator](ferramenta:controls) shows the Controls area and the four tools.
